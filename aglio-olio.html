                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook linguine in boiling water until nearly tender, 
                    6 to 8 minutes. Drain.</p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook 
                    and stir shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot butter and oil until shallots are 
                    translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Season shrimp with kosher salt and black pepper; add to the skillet 
                    and cook until pink, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.</p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of 
                    food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet, 
                    stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into butter mixture, and bring to a simmer. Toss linguine, shrimp, 
                    and parsley in the butter mixture until coated; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 
                    1 teaspoon olive oil to serve.</p>
